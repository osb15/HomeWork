# Spring API 

This project is a RESTful API built using Spring Boot. It supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and is designed to manage resources such as users, products, or employees.

## Features

- RESTful API with standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Built with Spring Boot for easy setup and configuration
- Integration with a relational database using Spring Data JPA
- JSON format for data exchange
- Optional authentication and authorization via JWT

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 8 or later
- Maven
- Spring Boot
- A relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL
- An API testing tool such as Postman

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

### Configure the Application

In the application configuration file (`application.properties` or `application.yml`), configure the database connection settings and any other necessary configurations such as authentication.

### Build the Project

Use Maven to build the project.

### Run the Application

You can run the Spring Boot application through the command line or your IDE.

### Test the API

Once the application is running, you can test the various endpoints using an API client like Postman. The API includes several endpoints for managing resources, including:

- Retrieving a list of resources
- Retrieving a specific resource by ID
- Creating a new resource
- Updating an existing resource
- Deleting a resource

### Authentication (Optional)

If your application uses authentication, JWT tokens can be used for secure access. Refer to the relevant Spring Security documentation to implement authentication.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure with the following key components:

- `controller`: Contains the API endpoint controllers
- `model`: Defines the data models
- `repository`: Handles database interactions via Spring Data JPA
- `service`: Contains the business logic

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Web
- A relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Maven
- (Optional) Spring Security for authentication
